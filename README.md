Python - Red Wine Machine Learning Application

Topic: Machine Learning Application to analyze physiochemical properties of red wines quality.

Brief Description of Main Functionality: 

The idea is to develop a Decision Tree Classifier that will enable by Machine Learning process, to predict the quality of a red wine. To do this, we have the physicochemical (input) characteristics and sensory (the output) which is the quality result numerically represented.
The model will be trained with pre-known data from a dataset that, using machine learning principles, will discover the patterns and apply them to make the prediction.
A GUI front end will display the results and allow the user to enter new input data and the model will predict the matching resulting category.

Categories: Earth / Nature

Dataset: red_wine_quality.csv

Content will include the following columns:
1 - fixed acidity 
2 - volatile acidity 
3 - citric acid 
4 - residual sugar 
5 - chlorides 
6 - free sulfur dioxide 
7 - total sulfur dioxide 
8 - density 
9 - pH 
10 - sulphates 
11 - alcohol 


Input variables (based on physicochemical tests).

Output variable (based on sensory data):  12 - quality (score between 0 and 10).
